# E-Portfolio JUnit_5

This project has only a few methods for a calculator. These will be tested with JUnit 5 tests. This project includes all needed code to test the methods. 
The only thing you need to do is clone this repository and to create a start configuration in your IDE. (I used IntelliJ)
